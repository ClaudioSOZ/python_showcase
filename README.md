This repository contains a show-case of python scripts developed for different purposes:

Fig1_plot_PB_2D_COLORMESH.py: Plots the rate of error of geopotential height at Z500 (a fundamental field on mid-latitude meteorology) for all forecast lead times and initialization times to highlight validation times where errors are more likely to occur, defined as Predictability barriers, output will make the initial figure of Sanchez et al. 2019 (in preparation)

output_models.py: Reads a database of location and intensity of forecasted tropical cyclones TC and outputs a chosen TC with a specific time format

plot_Int_traj.py: Plots trajectory, Intensity and 10m wind speed of a given TC

plot_dom_suite.py: Plots the domains specified in the cylc-rose suite of nested regional models, reading the input rose-suite.conf containing the relevant variables
